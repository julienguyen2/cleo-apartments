# Cleo Apartments
This project involved designing a user-friendly website for Cleo, a new student rental building. The site features 3 pages, including home, floor plans, and roommate matching.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Frontend**: HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Programming Environment**: Visual Studio Code

## Achievements & Areas for Improvement
I feel proud of my ability to stick to a color palette, my font choices, and drawing inspiration from the design contest’s winner and the content document. These elements contributed to a visually cohesive website. Given more time, I would have added an interactive map to highlight nearby locations around Cleo, enhancing the site’s functionality. This feature would have enhanced the user experience by providing a visual representation of the property's surroundings.

## Feedback and Changes
Based on feedback from three critiques, I made the following changes to the project:
- Improved responsiveness for better performance on all devices.
- Enhanced color contrast for improved accessibility.
- Simplified navigation to improve user experience.

## Resources and Assets
I utilized Bootstrap for the website framework and Bootstrap icons to represent amenities. These resources were instrumental in creating a responsive and visually appealing website. 

## Key Design Decisions
My key design decisions were influenced by the best-rated designs made for the Cleo website. I noticed that these designs had a specific color palette and typography, which I implemented in my design. This decision contributed to a consistent and professional look and feel across the website.

## Customization of Framework Design
I customized the Bootstrap framework, particularly the grid system, to structure and suit the specific needs of the Cleo website. These customizations included modifying the default Bootstrap styles to match the chosen color palette and typography. This allowed for a unique responsive layout that aligns with the website's overall design and functionality.

## Advanced Features
Features incorporated into the project include responsive design using Bootstrap’s grid system and interactive elements such as image carousels and hover effects.

## Challenges
One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring responsive design. Initially, I did not use mobile-first principles, which led to inconsistencies in the code on certain pages. Addressing these issues required refining the CSS and Bootstrap to ensure a clean user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
